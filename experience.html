                             <p>I like to talk about my experiences every semester break. Before I started my studies at UiTM Kedah, I worked in a <mark>boutique</mark> located nearby in my home area.
                                I worked there for almost 6 months. Every month my co -workers and I work hard to raise sales. Throughout my work there, I have received various gifts from my employer for successfully achieving the sales targets that have been set each month. 
                                However, two months before I continued my studies at UiTM Kedah, I decided to resign. However, after the first semester ended, I was asked to return to work part -time. However, after the second semester break I decided to look for a new job to find experience elsewhere. 
                                So, I work at <i>Moduslink Factory</i> located in <i>Autocity, Juru, Penang.</i> I worked there for 3 weeks and there were a few more jobs I did in the other semester break.</p>

                                <p>During the last semester break, my friend and I worked at one of the viral restaurants in Penang. However, it is quite difficult for me to get along with my colleagues because most of them are men even though only me and my friend are women. Along the way I sought work experience everywhere. <mark> learned that every thing or a job is not an easy thing. Therefore, we must respect the work of others. I have also encountered various human causes and from that, I can learn to be patient. I can also increase my social power by communicating with customers or outsiders.</mark></p>
